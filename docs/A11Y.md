Accessibility Playbook (A11Y) for EduX

Overview
- This document explains how to run accessibility checks locally, interpret results, and add new tests.

Run tests locally
- Install deps: npm ci
- Run Jest-based accessibility tests (axe): npm run test:a11y
  - This runs `__tests__/components/accessibility.simple.test.js` and `Navbar.accessibility.test.js` plus other component axe tests.

Lighthouse local run
- Install LHCI globally (optional): npm i -g @lhci/cli
- Run locally to get a public report (temporary storage): npm run lhci:local

Interpreting axe results
- Test failures show the violating element and the rule. Start by fixing:
  - aria-required-children: ensure menu/list roles have correct child roles
  - aria-input-field-name: inputs with ARIA need accessible names via aria-label or aria-labelledby
  - color-contrast: fix CSS colors to match contrast ratios
- Add a test case reproducing the issue, then fix in code and re-run tests until pass.

Writing new accessibility tests
- Use Testing Library to render component and jest-axe to assert no violations
- Place tests under `__tests__/components/` named `*.accessibility.test.js`
- For components with async behavior (media or fetch), mock external APIs and increase timeout if needed

CI notes
- CI now runs `npm run test:a11y` on push and PRs via `.github/workflows/a11y-tests.yml`.
- Also we have Lighthouse CI configured in `.github/workflows/lighthouse-ci.yml`.

Tips & Common fixes
- Prefer semantic HTML (button, nav, ul/li) over ARIA where possible
- Use role="menu" and role="menuitem" consistently, or use <ul role="list"> with <li role="listitem"> if representing lists
- Ensure interactive elements are keyboard-focusable (buttons, anchors) and have descriptive aria-labels

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a PR with this playbook and the recent accessibility fixes, or
- Expand the playbook with a checklist and remediation templates for common a11y issues.
